## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v20 or higher recommended)
- pnpm

## Installation
```bash
pnpm i
```

## Local Development
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building for Production

This will generate a dist folder containing the optimized production build.

## Customization
If you just want to get your site up and running quickly, you probably don't need to modify the code directly, all you need to change is src/utils/config.ts. It probably includes all configuration you need.
